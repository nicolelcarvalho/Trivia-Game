# Seinfeld Trivia Game

## Overview

Created during Week 3 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a Trivia game of your choice using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I took on the advanced version that required the game to display only one question at a time and advances to the next question once the player answers or once the timer runs out. 

## Utilizing the App

* View the app: [Github Pages Project Link](https://nicolelcarvalho.github.io/TriviaGame/)

* A TV is displayed on the screen. The player must click "Start Game" to begin the questions.
* The player is then prompted with a Seinfeld trivia question and 4 choices. They have 25 second to answer the question. 
* If the player selects the correct answer, a message will appear that they are correct and a gify is displayed that is relevant to the answer. 
* If the player selects the wrong answer, a message will appear that they are incorrect and a gify is displayed that is relevant to the answer. 
* If the player runs out of time to answer, the correct answer is displayed as well as the gify. 
* The player then advances to the next question. 
* At the end of the game, a final screen is displayed that allows the player to see how many questions they got correct, how many they got wrong and how many they didn't answer. The player also has the option to restart the game.
